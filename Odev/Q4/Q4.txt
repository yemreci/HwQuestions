The difference between reference type and value type is when a variable passed as value type it is the copy of the value of the variable whereas when a variable
passed as reference type it's address is passed so when a change occurs in the variable that the address denote it means the original value of the variable has changed.
Reference types are held in the heap memory except for the address of the said reference (which may also be stored in the heap in some cases)
Value types may be stored both on the heap and stack memory according to where they are used.
