Recursion lets us call functions recursively. The function calls itself during return process to return a value that is often associated with the initial return
until a closing condition met such as num = 1 in our function's case. Every function call during return getting added onto stack until closing condition
after that functions gets out of stack one by one until the base function call is returns it's value.
